# TwitterFeedCoding
Please write a program to simulate a twitter-like feed. Your program will receive two seven-bit ASCII files. The first file contains a list of users and their followers. The second file contains tweets. Given the users, followers and tweets, the objective is to display a simulated twitter feed for each user to the console. You will receive sample text files to use as input.
